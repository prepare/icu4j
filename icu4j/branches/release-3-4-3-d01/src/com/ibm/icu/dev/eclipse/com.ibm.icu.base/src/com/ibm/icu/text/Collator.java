/**
* <p>Collator performs locale-sensitive string comparison.</p>
*
* <p>Following the <a href=http://www.unicode.org>Unicode
* Consortium</a>'s specifications for the
* <a href="http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr10/"> Unicode Collation
* Algorithm (UCA)</a>, there are 5 different levels of strength used
* in comparisons:
*
* <ul>
* <li>PRIMARY strength: Typically, this is used to denote differences between
*     base characters (for example, "a" &lt; "b").
*     It is the strongest difference. For example, dictionaries are divided
*     into different sections by base character.
* <li>SECONDARY strength: Accents in the characters are considered secondary
*     differences (for example, "as" &lt; "&agrave;s" &lt; "at"). Other
*     differences
*     between letters can also be considered secondary differences, depending
*     on the language. A secondary difference is ignored when there is a
*     primary difference anywhere in the strings.
* <li>TERTIARY strength: Upper and lower case differences in characters are
*     distinguished at tertiary strength (for example, "ao" &lt; "Ao" &lt;
*     "a&ograve;"). In addition, a variant of a letter differs from the base
*     form on the tertiary strength (such as "A" and "&#9398;"). Another
*     example is the
*     difference between large and small Kana. A tertiary difference is ignored
*     when there is a primary or secondary difference anywhere in the strings.
* <li>QUATERNARY strength: When punctuation is ignored
*     <a href="http://icu.sourceforge.net/userguide/Collate_Concepts.html#Ignoring_Punctuation">
*     (see Ignoring Punctuations in the user guide)</a> at PRIMARY to TERTIARY
*     strength, an additional strength level can
*     be used to distinguish words with and without punctuation (for example,
*     "ab" &lt; "a-b" &lt; "aB").
*     This difference is ignored when there is a PRIMARY, SECONDARY or TERTIARY
*     difference. The QUATERNARY strength should only be used if ignoring
*     punctuation is required.
* <li>IDENTICAL strength:
*     When all other strengths are equal, the IDENTICAL strength is used as a
*     tiebreaker. The Unicode code point values of the NFD form of each string
*     are compared, just in case there is no difference.
*     For example, Hebrew cantellation marks are only distinguished at this
*     strength. This strength should be used sparingly, as only code point
*     value differences between two strings is an extremely rare occurrence.
*     Using this strength substantially decreases the performance for both
*     comparison and collation key generation APIs. This strength also
*     increases the size of the collation key.
* </ul>
*
* Unlike the JDK, ICU4J's Collator deals only with 2 decomposition modes,
* the canonical decomposition mode and one that does not use any decomposition.
* The compatibility decomposition mode, java.text.Collator.FULL_DECOMPOSITION
* is not supported here. If the canonical
* decomposition mode is set, the Collator handles un-normalized text properly,
* producing the same results as if the text were normalized in NFD. If
* canonical decomposition is turned off, it is the user's responsibility to
* ensure that all text is already in the appropriate form before performing
* a comparison or before getting a CollationKey.</p>
*
* <p>For more information about the collation service see the
* <a href="http://icu.sourceforge.net/userguide/Collate_Intro.html">users
* guide</a>.</p>
*
* <p>Examples of use
* <pre>
* // Get the Collator for US English and set its strength to PRIMARY
* Collator usCollator = Collator.getInstance(Locale.US);
* usCollator.setStrength(Collator.PRIMARY);
* if (usCollator.compare("abc", "ABC") == 0) {
*     System.out.println("Strings are equivalent");
* }
*
* The following example shows how to compare two strings using the
* Collator for the default locale.
*
* // Compare two strings in the default locale
* Collator myCollator = Collator.getInstance();
* myCollator.setDecomposition(NO_DECOMPOSITION);
* if (myCollator.compare("&agrave;&#92;u0325", "a&#92;u0325&#768;") != 0) {
*     System.out.println("&agrave;&#92;u0325 is not equals to a&#92;u0325&#768; without decomposition");
*     myCollator.setDecomposition(CANONICAL_DECOMPOSITION);
*     if (myCollator.compare("&agrave;&#92;u0325", "a&#92;u0325&#768;") != 0) {
*         System.out.println("Error: &agrave;&#92;u0325 should be equals to a&#92;u0325&#768; with decomposition");
*     }
*     else {
*         System.out.println("&agrave;&#92;u0325 is equals to a&#92;u0325&#768; with decomposition");
*     }
* }
* else {
*     System.out.println("Error: &agrave;&#92;u0325 should be not equals to a&#92;u0325&#768; without decomposition");
* }
