<h3><a NAME="introduction"></a><u>Introduction to ICU4J (International Components for Unicode for Java)</u></h3>

<p>Today's global market demands programs that support a wide variety
    of languages and national conventions.&nbsp; Customers prefer software
    and web pages tailored to their needs, and studies confirm that
    this leads to increased sales.&nbsp;  Java provides a strong
    foundation for global programs, and IBM and the ICU4J team played
    a key role in providing globalization technology to Sun for use in
    Java. </p>
    <p>
    But Java does not yet provide all the features that some products require.&nbsp; ICU4J is an add-on library that extends Java's globalization technology by providing the following tools:
    <ul> 
    <li> 
    Unicode Normalization – NFC, NFD, NFKD, NFKC
    	<blockquote>Produces canonical text representations, needed for XML and the net.</blockquote>
    <li>
    International Calendars – Arabic, Buddhist, Hebrew, and Japanese
              <blockquote>Required for correct presentation of dates in some countries.</blockquote>
    <li> 
    Number Format Enhancements – Scientific Notation, Spelled-out Numbers
              <blockquote>Enhances standard Java number formatting. The spelled-out format is used
for checks and similar documents.</blockquote>

    <li>Enhanced word-break detection – Rule-based, supports Thai
              <blockquote>Required for correct support of Thai.</blockquote>

    <li>Unicode Text Compression – Standard compression of Unicode text
              <blockquote>Suitable for large numbers of small fields, where LZW and similar schemes
do not apply.</blockquote>
    </ul>
In some cases, the above support has been rolled into a later release of
Java. For example, the Thai word-break is now in Java 1.4. However, if you
are using Java 1.2, you can use the ICU4J package until you upgrade to 1.4.
</p>

<h3><a name=license></a><u>License Information</u></h3>
<p>
The ICU projects (ICU4C and ICU4J) now use the X license.&nbsp; The X license is a non-viral and recommended free software license that is compatible with the GNU GPL license.&nbsp; This became effective with release 1.8.1 of ICU4C and release 1.3.1 of ICU4J in mid-2001. All new ICU releases will adopt the X license; previous ICU releases continue to utilize the IPL (IBM Public LIcense).&nbsp; Users of previous releases of ICU who want to adopt new ICU releases will need to accept the terms and conditions of the X license.
</p>
<p>
The main effect of the change is to provide GPL compatibility.&nbsp; The X license is listed as GPL compatible, see the gnu page at <a href=http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/license-list.html#GPLCompatibleLicenses>
http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/license-list.html#GPLCompatibleLicenses</a>
</p>
<p>
The text of the X license is available at <a href=http://www.x.org/terms.htm>http://www.x.org/terms.htm</a>. The IBM version contains the essential text of the license, omitting the X-specific trademarks and copyright notices.
</p>
<p>
For more details please see the <a href=http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/press.html>press announcement</a> and the <a href=http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/project_faq.html#license>Project FAQ</a>.
</p>

<h3><a NAME="PlatformDependencies"></a><u>Platform Dependencies</u></h3>

<p>Parts of ICU4J depend on functionality that is only available in Java2 (JDK1.2) or
later, although some components work under 1.1.&nbsp; However, all components should be
compiled using a Java 1.2.x or 1.3.x compiler, as even components that run using a 1.1.x JVM may require
language features that are only present in Java2.&nbsp; Currently 1.1.x is unsupported and
untested, and you use the components on a 1.1.x system at your own risk.</p>

<p>ICU4J is currently not compatible with JDK1.4 (in beta as of this writing).  We anticipate adding
support for JDK1.4 in a future release.</p>

<h3><a NAME="obtaining"></a><u>How to Download ICU4J</u></h3>

<p>There are two ways to download the ICU4J releases.

<ul type="disc">
  <li><b>Official Release Snapshot:</b><br>

    If you want to use ICU4J (as opposed to developing it), your best
    bet is to download an official, packaged version of the ICU4J
    source code.&nbsp; These versions are tested more thoroughly than
    day-to-day development builds, and they are packaged in zip files
    for convenient download.&nbsp; These packaged files can be found
    at <a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu4j/download/index.html">http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu4j/download/index.html</a>.&nbsp; If a packaged snapshot is named <b>ICU4JXXXXXX.zip</b>, where XXXXXX is
    the release version number.&nbsp; Please unzip this file.&nbsp; It
    will reconstruct the source directory. </li>

</ul>

<ul type="disc">
  <li><b>CVS Source Repository:</b><br>
    If you are interested in developing features, patches, or bug fixes for ICU4J, you should
    probably be working with the latest version of the ICU4J source code. You will need to
    check the code out of our CVS repository to ensure that you have the most recent version
    of all of the files. There are several ways to do this: <br>
    <ul type="circle">
      <li>WebCVS:<br>
        If you want to browse the code and only make occasional downloads, you may want to use
        WebCVS. It provides a convenient, web-based interface for browsing and downloading the
        latest version of the ICU4J source code and documentation. You can also view each file's
        revision history, display the differences between individual revisions, determine which
        revisions were part of which official release, and so on. <br>
      </li>
      <li>WinCVS:<br>
        If you will be doing serious work on ICU4J, you should probably install a CVS client on
        your own machine so that you can do batch operations without going through the WebCVS
        interface. On Windows, we suggest the WinCVS client. The following is the example
        instruction on how to download ICU4J via WinCVS: <ol>
          <li>Install the WinCVS client, which you can download from the <a
            href="http://www.wincvs.org">http://www.wincvs.org</a>.</li>
          <li>Select <strong>Preferences</strong> from the <strong>Admin</strong> menu.<ol type="a">
              <li>On the <strong>General</strong> tab panel: Set your <strong>CVSROOT</strong> to &quot;<strong>:pserver:anoncvs@oss.software.ibm.com:/usr/cvs/icu4j</strong>&quot;.<br>
                Leave other options on this page at their default.</li>
              <li>On the <strong>Ports</strong> tab panel: Check the <strong>pserver</strong> checkbox and
                enter port <strong>2401</strong>.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Click on the Login menu button (<strong>Admin</strong> menu). Enter in  &quot;<strong>anoncvs</strong>&quot; when requested.</li>
          <li>To extract the most recent version of ICU4J, select <strong>Checkout module</strong>
            from the <strong>Create</strong> menu. Specify &quot;<strong>icu4j</strong>&quot; for the
            module name. This will create a new copy of the workspace on your local hard drive.</li>
          <li>In the future, you can download updated files from the repository to your hard drive
            using the <strong>Update selection</strong> item in the <strong>Modify</strong> menu.<br>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>CVS command line:<br>
        You can also check out the repository anonymously on UNIX using the following commands,
        after first setting your CVSROOT to point to the ICU4J repository: <pre><code>export CVSROOT=:pserver:anoncvs@oss.software.ibm.com:/usr/cvs/icu4j 
cvs login CVS password: anoncvs 
cvs checkout icu4j 
cvs logout</code></pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3><a NAME="WhatContain"></a><u>The Structure and Contents of ICU4J</u></h3>

<p>Below, <b>$Root</b> is the placement of the icu directory in your file system, like
&quot;drive:\...\icu4j&quot; in your environment. &quot;drive:\...&quot; stands for any

  <tr>
    <td>$Root/doc</td>

  </tr>
</table>

<p><b>Data organization:</b> </p>

<p>Data is stored in various locations in ICU4J:

<ul>
  <li>Data that is &quot;raw&quot; data goes into <strong>$Root/src/data</strong>. This
    includes things like the raw Unicode database. <strong>$Root/src/data</strong> does <em>not</em>
    contain <strong>.java</strong> source files.</li>
  <li>Data that is in the form of a Java class, typically (but not necessarily) a ResourceBundle, 
    goes into one of the packages <code>com.ibm.util.resources</code> or <code>com.ibm.text.resources</code>,
    depending on whether the associated code lives in <code>com.ibm.util</code> or <code>com.ibm.text</code>.</li>
  <li>Data that is not part of ICU4J proper (or its base tool set), but rather part of a test,
    sample, or demo, should go near the source code of its owner. This makes it easy to ship a
    core ICU4J release without optional components.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a NAME="HowToInstallJavac"></a><u>How to Install and Build</u></h3>

<p>To install ICU4J, simply place the prebuilt jar file <strong>icu4j.jar</strong> on your
Java CLASSPATH.&nbsp; No other files are needed.</p>

<p>We strongly recommend using the Ant build system to build ICU4J.  If you don't have
them you will need to install the JDK and Ant:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It's recommended to install both the JDK and Ant somewhere <em>outside</em> the ICU4J
    directory, to keep them out of CVS's hair. For example, on Linux you might install these
    in /usr/local.</li>
  <li>Install a recent JDK, version 1.2.x or 1.3.x will work. ICU4J does not yet build with JDK 1.4.</li>
  <li><p>Next install the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/"><strong>Ant</strong></a> build
    system, part of the Apache Software Foundation's <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/"><strong>Jakarta</strong></a>
    project. Ant is a portable, Java-based build system similar to make. ICU4J uses Ant
    because it introduces no other dependencies, it's portable, and it's easier to manage than
    a collection of makefiles. We currently build ICU4J using a single makefile on both
    Windows 9x and Linux using Ant.</p>
    <p>Installing Ant is straightforward. Download it (see <a
    href="http://jakarta.apache.org/downloads/binindex.html">http://jakarta.apache.org/downloads/binindex.html</a>),
    extract it onto your system, set some environment variables, and add its bin directory to
    your path. For example:<pre>    set JAVA_HOME=C:\jdk1.3.1
    set ANT_HOME=C:\jakarta-ant
    set PATH=%PATH%;%ANT_HOME%\bin</pre></p>
    <p>See the current Ant documentation for details.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Once the JDK and Ant are installed, building is just a matter of
typing <strong>ant</strong> in the ICU4J root directory. This causes
the Ant build system to perform a build as specified by the file
<strong>build.xml</strong>, located in the ICU4J root directory. You
can give Ant options like -verbose, and you can specify targets. Ant
will only build what's been changed and will resolve dependencies
properly.  For example:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>F:\icu4j&gt;ant tests
Buildfile: build.xml
Project base dir set to: F:\icu4j
Executing Target: core
Compiling 71 source files to F:\icu4j\classes
Executing Target: tests
Compiling 24 source files to F:\icu4j\classes
Completed in 19 seconds</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Current targets that you can give after <strong>ant</strong>:</p>
<div align="left">

<table border="1" cellpadding="0">
  <tr>
    <td>all</td>
    <td>Build all targets.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>core</td>

    unwanted things like CVS directories and emacs backup files. The zip file <strong>icu4jYYYYMMDD.zip</strong>
    will be created in the directory <em>above</em> the root ICU4J directory, where YYYYMMDD
    is today's date. Any existing file of that name will be overwritten.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>richeditDocs</td>
    <td>Run javadoc over the richedit class files, generating an HTML documentation tree in the
    subdirectory <strong>./richeditDist/richedit/doc</strong>.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>richeditJar</td> <td>Create a jar archive
    <strong>richedit.jar</strong> in the
    <strong>./richeditDist/richedit</strong> subdirectory, containing
    the richedit class files.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>richeditZip</td>
    <td>Create a zip archive of the richedit docs and richedit jar file for distribution, excluding
    unwanted things like CVS directories and emacs backup files. The zip file <strong>richedit.zip</strong>
    will be created in the <strong>./richeditDist</strong> subdirectory. Any existing file of 
    that name will be overwritten.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>zipsrc</td>
    <td>Like the <strong>zip</strong> target, without the docs and the jar file. The zip file <strong>icu4jsrcYYYYMMDD.zip</strong>
    will be created in the directory <em>above</em> the root ICU4J directory.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>clean</td>
    <td>Remove all built targets, leaving the source.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>For more information, read the Ant documentation and the <strong>build.xml</strong>
file.</p>

<p>After doing a build it is a good idea to run all the icu4j tests by typing <br>&quot;java
-classpath $Root/classes -DUnicodeData=$Root/src/data/unicode com.ibm.test.TestAll&quot;.</p>

<p>(If you are allergic to build systems, as an alternative to using
Ant you can build by running javac and javadoc directly. This
is not recommended. You may have to manually create destination
directories.)</p>
