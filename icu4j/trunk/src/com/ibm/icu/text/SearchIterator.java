/**
 * <code>SearchIterator</code> is an abstract base class that provides methods
 * to search for a pattern within a text string.  Instances of
 * <code>SearchIterator</code> maintain a current position and scan over
 * the target text, returning the indices the pattern is matched
 * and the length of each match.
 * <p>
 * <code>SearchIterator</code> is an abstract base class that defines a
 * protocol for text searching.  Subclasses provide concrete implementations of
 * various search algorithms.  For example, {@link StringSearch}
 * implements language-sensitive pattern matching based on the comparison rules
 * defined in a {@link java.text.RuleBasedCollator RuleBasedCollator} object.
 * <p>
 * Internally, <code>SearchIterator</code> scans text using a
 * {@link CharacterIterator}, and is thus able to scan text held
 * by any object implementing that protocol. A <code>StringCharacterIterator</code>
 * is used to scan <code>String</code> objects passed to <code>setText</code>.
 * <p>
 * <code>SearchIterator</code> provides an API that is similar to that of
 * other text iteration classes such as <code>BreakIterator</code>.  Using this
 * class, it is easy to scan through text looking for all occurances of a
 * given pattern.  The following example uses a <code>StringSearch</code> object to
 * find all instances of "fox" in the target string.  Any other subclass of
 * <code>SearchIterator</code> can be used in an identical manner.
 * <pre><code>
 * String target = "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy fox";
 * String pattern = "fox";
 *
 * SearchIterator iter = new StringSearch(pattern, target);
 *
 * for (int pos = iter.first(); pos != SearchIterator.DONE; pos = iter.next()) {
 *     System.out.println("Found match at " + pos +
 *                        ", length is " + iter.getMatchLength());
 * }
 * </code></pre>
 *
