         * written out in words: the ideographic characters are both digits
         * and words.  This rule set provides two variants:  %traditional
         * uses the traditional CJK numerals (which are also used in China
         * and Korea).  %financial uses alternate ideographs for many numbers
         * that are harder to alter than the traditional numerals (one could
         * fairly easily change a one to
         * a three just by adding two strokes, for example).  This is also done in
         * the other countries using Chinese idographs, but different ideographs
         * are used in those places.
