/**
 * A TextOffset indicates both an integer offset into text and a placement
 * on one of the characters adjacent to the offset.  An offset is a
 * position between two characters;  offset n
 * is between character n-1 and character n.  The placement specifies whether
 * it is associated with the character
 * after the offset
 * (character n) or the character before the offset (character n-1).
 * <p>
 * Knowing which character the TextOffset is associated with is necessary
 * when displaying carets.  In bidirectional text, a single offset may
 * have two distinct carets.  Also, in multiline text, an offset at a line
 * break has a possible caret on each line.
 * <p>
 * Most clients will not be interested in the placement, and will just use
 * the offset.
