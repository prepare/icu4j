    Change history:

    10/29/96 jef    split the character and paragraph style access functions
    8/14/96 sfb     eliminated StyleSheetIterator
    8/21/96 jef        completed abstract interface (changed iterator classes etc.)
    1/30/97 rtg     cleaned up interface, brought in functions from SimpleTextView
    7/31/98 jbr switched from Style to AttributeMap

/**
 * This class is a mutable extension of MConstText.  It has methods for
 * inserting, appending, replacing, and removing styled text.  Additionally,
 * it has methods for modifying paragraph and character styles.
 * <p>
 * Styled characters (from another <code>MConstText</code> instance) added
 * to the text retain their original character styles.  The style of plain characters
 * (specified as a <code>char</code> or <code>char[]</code>) is always
 * specified explicitly when they are added to the text.  MText does not do
 * character style "propagation", where unstyled characters take on the
 * style of previous characters.  Clients can implement this behavior by
 * specifying the styles to propagate.
 * <p>
 * When unstyled characters are added to the text, their paragraph style
 * is the paragraph style in effect immediately after the last new character.
 * If the characters contain paragraph separators, then every new paragraph
 * will have the same paragraph style.  When styled characters are added
 * to the text, their resulting paragraph style is determined by the
 * following rule:
 * <blockquote>
 * The paragraph styles in the new text
 * become the paragraph styles in the target text, with the exception of the
 * last paragraph in the new text, which takes on the paragraph style in
 * effect immediately after the inserted text.
 * If the new text is added at the end of the target text, the new text's
 * paragraph styles take effect in any paragraph affected by the addition.
 * </blockquote>
 * For example, suppose there is a single paragraph of text with style 'A',
 * delimited with a paragraph separator 'P':
 * <blockquote>
 * AAAAAAP
 * </blockquote>
 * Suppose the following styled paragraphs are inserted into the above text
 * after the fourth character:
 * <blockquote>
 * BBBBPCCCPDDD
 * </blockquote>
 * Then the original paragraph style of each character is:
 * <blockquote>
 * AAAABBBBPCCCPDDDAAP
 * </blockquote>
 * The resulting paragraph styles are:
 * <blockquote>
 * BBBBBBBBPCCCPAAAAAP
 * </blockquote>
 * Similarly, if characters are deleted, the paragraph style immediately
 * after the deletion takes effect on the paragraph containing the deletion.
 * So, if characters 4-16 were deleted in the example above, the paragraph
 * styles would be:
 * <blockquote>
 * AAAAAAP
 * </blockquote>
 * This paragraph-style propagation policy is sometimes referred to as <strong>
 * following styles win</strong>, since styles at the end of the paragraph
 * become the style for the entire paragraph.
 * <p>
 * This class can accumulate a <strong>damaged range</strong> - an interval in
 * which characters, character styles, or paragraph styles have changed.  This is
 * useful for clients such as text editors which reformat and draw text after
 * changes.  Usually the damaged range is exactly the range of characters
 * operated upon;  however, larger ranges may be damaged if paragraph styles
 * change.
