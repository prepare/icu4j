/*
* MStyleBuffer is the abstract interface for a class which maintains
* style runs in an <tt>MText</tt>.  A "style run" consists of a
* style and the interval on which the style applies.
* <p>
* MStyleBuffer includes methods to call when text is inserted into
* or deleted from the <tt>MText</tt>.  These methods update the
* style runs in accordance with the commonly accepted behavior for
* style runs.
* <p>
* Additionally, MStyleBuffer provides methods for replacing the style runs on a
* text range with another set of style runs.  MStyleBuffer does not do style "combining" (for
* example, adding the bold attribute to text which is italicized);  clients are
* responsible for computing the combined styles, and passing these styles into
* MStyleBuffer.
* <p>
* MStyleBuffer supplies a method for replacing the style runs on a text range with the runs
* represented in an <tt>MStyleRunIterator</tt>.  This is useful for implementing paste
* operations, in which the style runs on a range of text are replaced by style runs
* from an external source.
* <p>
