/**
 * <p>A subclass of BreakIterator whose behavior is specified using a list of rules.</p>
 *
 * <p>There are two kinds of rules, which are separated by semicolons: <i>substitutions</i>
 * and <i>regular expressions.</i></p>
 *
 * <p>A substitution rule defines a name that can be used in place of an expression. It
 * consists of a name, an equals sign, and an expression. (There can be no whitespace on 
 * either side of the equals sign.)  To keep its syntactic meaning intact, the expression 
 * must be enclosed in parentheses or square brackets. A substitution is visible after its 
 * definition, and is filled in using simple textual substitution (when a substitution is
 * used, its name is enclosed in curly braces.  The curly braces are optional in the
 * substition's definition). Substitution definitions can contain other substitutions, as
 * long as those substitutions have been defined first. Substitutions are generally used to
 * make the regular expressions (which can get quite complex) shorter and easier to read.
 * They typically define either character categories or commonly-used subexpressions.</p>
 *
 * <p>There is one special substitution.&nbsp; If the description defines a substitution
 * called &quot;_ignore_&quot;, the expression must be a [] expression, and the
 * expression defines a set of characters (the &quot;<em>ignore characters</em>&quot;) that
 * will be transparent to the BreakIterator.&nbsp; A sequence of characters will break the
 * same way it would if any ignore characters it contains are taken out.&nbsp; Break
 * positions never occur before ignore characters, except when the character before the
 * ignore characters is a line or paragraph terminator.</p>
 *
 * <p>A regular expression uses a syntax similar to the normal Unix regular-expression 
 * syntax, and defines a sequence of characters to be kept together. With one significant 
 * exception, the iterator uses a longest-possible-match algorithm when matching text to regular
 * expressions. The iterator also treats descriptions containing multiple regular expressions
 * as if they were ORed together (i.e., as if they were separated by |).</p>
 *
 * <p>The special characters recognized by the regular-expression parser are as follows:</p>
 *
 * <blockquote>
 *   <table border="1" width="100%">
 *     <tr>
 *       <td width="6%">*</td>
 *       <td width="94%">Specifies that the expression preceding the asterisk may occur any number
 *       of times (including not at all).</td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *       <td width="6%">+</td>
 *       <td width="94%">Specifies that the expression preceding the asterisk may occur one or
 *       more times, but must occur at least once.</td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *       <td width="6%">?</td>
 *       <td width="94%">Specifies that the expression preceding the asterisk may occur once
 *       or not at all (i.e., it makes the preceding expression optional).</td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *       <td width="6%">()</td>
 *       <td width="94%">Encloses a sequence of characters.  If followed by * or +, the 
 *       sequence repeats.  If followed by ?, the sequence is optional.  Otherwise, the 
 *       parentheses are just a grouping device and a way to delimit the ends of expressions 
 *       containing |.</td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *       <td width="6%">|</td>
 *       <td width="94%">Separates two alternative sequences of characters.&nbsp; Either one
 *       sequence or the other, but not both, matches this expression.&nbsp; The | character can
 *       only occur inside ().</td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *       <td width="6%">.</td>
 *       <td width="94%">Matches any character.</td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *       <td width="6%">*?</td>
 *       <td width="94%">Specifies a non-greedy asterisk.&nbsp; *? works the same way as *, except
 *       when there is overlap between the last group of characters in the expression preceding the
 *       * and the first group of characters following the *.&nbsp; When there is this kind of
 *       overlap, * will match the longest sequence of characters that match the expression before
 *       the *, and *? will match the shortest sequence of characters matching the expression
 *       before the *?.&nbsp; For example, if you have &quot;xxyxyyyxyxyxxyxyxyy&quot; in the text,
 *       &quot;x[xy]*x&quot; will match through to the last x (i.e., &quot;<strong>xxyxyyyxyxyxxyxyx</strong>yy&quot;,
 *       but &quot;x[xy]*?x&quot; will only match the first two xes (&quot;<strong>xx</strong>yxyyyxyxyxxyxyxyy&quot;).</td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *       <td width="6%">[]</td>
 *       <td width="94%">Specifies a group of alternative characters.&nbsp; A [] expression will
 *       match any single character that is specified in the [] expression.&nbsp; For more on the
 *       syntax of [] expressions, see below.</td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *       <td width="6%">/</td>
 *       <td width="94%">Specifies where the break position should go if text matches this
 *       expression.&nbsp; (e.g., &quot;[a-z]&#42;/[:Zs:]*[1-0]&quot; will match if the iterator sees a run
 *       of letters, followed by a run of whitespace, followed by a digit, but the break position
 *       will actually go before the whitespace).&nbsp; Expressions that don't contain / put the
 *       break position at the end of the matching text.</td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *       <td width="6%">\</td>
 *       <td width="94%">Escape character.&nbsp; The \ itself is ignored, but causes the next
 *       character to be treated as literal character.&nbsp; This has no effect for many
 *       characters, but for the characters listed above, this deprives them of their special
 *       meaning.&nbsp; (There are no special escape sequences for Unicode characters, or tabs and
 *       newlines; these are all handled by a higher-level protocol.&nbsp; In a Java string,
 *       &quot;\n&quot; will be converted to a literal newline character by the time the
 *       regular-expression parser sees it.&nbsp; Of course, this means that \ sequences that are
 *       visible to the regexp parser must be written as \\ when inside a Java string.)&nbsp; All
 *       characters in the ASCII range except for letters, digits, and control characters are
 *       reserved characters to the parser and must be preceded by \ even if they currently don't
 *       mean anything.</td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *       <td width="6%">!</td>
 *       <td width="94%">If ! appears at the beginning of a regular expression, it tells the regexp
 *       parser that this expression specifies the backwards-iteration behavior of the iterator,
 *       and not its normal iteration behavior.&nbsp; This is generally only used in situations
 *       where the automatically-generated backwards-iteration behavior doesn't produce
 *       satisfactory results and must be supplemented with extra client-specified rules.</td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *       <td width="6%"><em>(all others)</em></td>
 *       <td width="94%">All other characters are treated as literal characters, which must match
 *       the corresponding character(s) in the text exactly.</td>
 *     </tr>
 *   </table>
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * <p>Within a [] expression, a number of other special characters can be used to specify
 * groups of characters:</p>
 *
 * <blockquote>
 *   <table border="1" width="100%">
 *     <tr>
 *       <td width="6%">-</td>
 *       <td width="94%">Specifies a range of matching characters.&nbsp; For example
 *       &quot;[a-p]&quot; matches all lowercase Latin letters from a to p (inclusive).&nbsp; The -
 *       sign specifies ranges of continuous Unicode numeric values, not ranges of characters in a
 *       language's alphabetical order: &quot;[a-z]&quot; doesn't include capital letters, nor does
 *       it include accented letters such as a-umlaut.</td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *       <td width="6%">^</td>
 *       <td width="94%">Inverts the expression.  All characters the expression includes are
 *       excluded, and vice versa.  (i.e., it has the effect of saying "all Unicode characters
 *       except...")  This character only has its special meaning when it's the first character
 *       in the [] expression.  (Generally, you only see the ^ character inside a nested []
 *       expression used in conjunction with the syntax below.)</td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *       <td width="6%"><em>(all others)</em></td>
 *       <td width="94%">All other characters are treated as literal characters.&nbsp; (For
 *       example, &quot;[aeiou]&quot; specifies just the letters a, e, i, o, and u.)</td>
 *     </tr>
 *   </table>
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * <p>[] expressions can nest.  There are some other characters that have special meaning only
 * when used in conjunction with nester [] expressions:</p>
 *
 * <blockquote>
 *   <table border="1" width="100%">
 *     <tr>
 *       <td width="6%">::</td>
 *       <td width="94%">Within a nested [] expression, a pair of colons containing a one- or 
 *       two-letter code matches all characters in the corresponding Unicode category.&nbsp; 
 *       The :: expression has to be the only thing inside the [] expression. The two-letter codes 
 *       are the same as the two-letter codes in the Unicode database (for example, 
 *       &quot;[[:Sc:][:Sm:]]&quot; matches all currency symbols and all math symbols).&nbsp; 
 *       Specifying a one-letter code is the same as specifying all two-letter codes that begin 
 *       with that letter (for example, &quot;[[:L:]]&quot; matches all letters, and is equivalent 
 *       to &quot;[[:Lu:][:Ll:][:Lo:][:Lm:][:Lt:]]&quot;).&nbsp; Anything other than a valid 
 *       two-letter Unicode category code or a single letter that begins a valide Unicode category 
 *       code is illegal within the colons.</td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *       <td width="6%">|</td>
 *       <td width="94%">Two nested [] expressions juxtaposed or separated only by a | character
 *       are merged together into a single [] expression matching all the characters in either
 *       of the original [] expressions.  (e.g., "[[ab][bc]]" is equivalent to "[abc]", and so
 *       is "[[ab]|[bc]]". <b>NOTE:</b>  "[ab][bc]" is NOT the same thing as "[[ab][bc]]".  
 *       The first expression will match two characters: an a or b followed by either another 
 *       b or a c.  The second expression will match a single character, which may be a, b, or c.
 *       The nesting is <em>required</em> for the expressions to merge together.</td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *       <td width="6%">&</td>
 *       <td width="94%">Two nested [] expressions with only & between them will match any 
 *       character that appears in both nested [] expressions (this is a set intersection).
 *       (e.g., "[[ab]&[bc]]" will only match the letter b.)</td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *       <td width="6%">-</td>
 *       <td width="94%">Two nested [] expressions with - between them will match any
 *       character that appears in the first nested [] expression <em>but not</em> the
 *       second one (this is an asymmetrical set difference).  (e.g., "[[:Sc:]-[$]]"
 *       matches any currency symbol except the dollar sign.  "[[ab]-[bc]] will match
 *       only the letter a.  This has exactly the same effect as "[[ab]&[^bc]]".)</td>
 *     </tr>

            //   ambiguous whether the user wants a greedy or non-greedy match in these cases.
            //   (e.g., whether "[a-z]*abc" means the SHORTEST sequence of letters ending in
            //   "abc" or the LONGEST sequence of letters ending in "abc".  We've adopted
            //   the *? to mean "shortest" and * by itself to mean "longest".  (You get the
            //   same result with both if there's no overlap between the repeating character
            //   group and the group immediately following it.)  Handling the *? token is
            //   rather complicated and involves keeping track of whether a state needs to
            //   be merged (as described above) or merely overwritten when you update one of
            //   its cells, and copying the contents of a state that loops with a *? token
            //   into some of the states that follow it after the rest of the table-building
            //   process is complete ("backfilling").
            // implementation notes:
            //   - This function assumes syntax checking has been performed on the input string
            //   prior to its being passed in here.  It assumes that parentheses are
            //   balanced, all literal characters are enclosed in [] and turned into category
            //   numbers, that there are no illegal characters or character sequences, and so
            //   on.  Violation of these invariants will lead to undefined behavior.
            //   - It'd probably be better to use linked lists rather than Vector and Stack
            //   to maintain the decision point list and stack.  I went for simplicity in
            //   this initial implementation.  If performance is critical enough, we can go
            //   back and fix this later.
            //   -There are a number of important limitations on the *? token.  It does not work
            //   right when followed by a repeating character sequence (e.g., ".*?(abc)*")
            //   (although it does work right when followed by a single repeating character).
            //   It will not always work right when nested in parentheses or braces (although
            //   sometimes it will).  It also will not work right if the group of repeating
            //   characters and the group of characters that follows overlap partially
            //   (e.g., "[a-g]*?[e-j]").  None of these capabilites was deemed necessary for
            //   describing breaking rules we know about, so we left them out for
            //   expeditiousness.
            //   - Rules such as "[a-z]*?abc;" will be treated the same as "[a-z]*?aa*bc;"--
            //   that is, if the string ends in "aaaabc", the break will go before the first
